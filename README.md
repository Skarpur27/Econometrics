# Unemployment and Business Creation
## Project Overview
This project seeks to empirically validate Joseph Schumpeter's theory that unemployment rates have a significant impact on the rates of business creation. By employing a variety of univariate and multivariate econometric models, we analyze data to explore this relationship, leveraging advanced statistical techniques to draw meaningful conclusions.

## Methodology
Our analytical approach involved several key steps, including:

**Univariate and Multivariate Modeling**: To understand the relationship between unemployment rates and business creation rates from different analytical perspectives.  
**Autocorrelation Analysis**: Utilizing autocorrelograms to examine the data for patterns of autocorrelation.  
**AR Modeling**: Developing autoregressive models based on the variables to predict future values.  
**Significance Testing**: Employing tests to determine the significance of the variables and their relationships.  
**AIC and BIC Criteria**: Using Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion to select the best model.  
**Philips Perron Test**: To check for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity within the dataset.  
**ADF Test**: Applying the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to assess stationarity in the time series data.  
**KPSS Test**: Conducting the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test as an additional check for stationarity.  
**Ljong-Box Test**: Analyzing autocorrelation of residuals in the series.  
**ARCH Effect Test**: Examining the heteroskedasticity of errors to ensure model reliability.  
**MA Modeling**: Incorporating moving average components to better model the data.  
**VAR Modeling**: Implementing a Vector Autoregression model with one lag to explore the dynamic relationship between variables.  
**Granger Causality Tes**: Testing for causal relationships between unemployment rates and business creation rates.  
**Impulse-Response Analysis**: Conducting an analysis using orthogonalized shocks via a Cholesky decomposition to examine the effect of one variable on another over time.
